Oh man, just watched Cleaner, right? Broooo, lemme tell ya, I didn't know cleaning could get that intense. Samuel L. Jackson's out there like the cleaning ninja, doing all that crime scene stuff, and I’m just here like, Dude, I can barely dust my shelves without sneezing my head off. 😂

Anyway, it got me thinking, you remember that crazy appointment I had last Tuesday with Mrs. Too-Many-Knots-To-Count? Kinda felt like I was cleaning a crime scene myself. Lol, all those knots and tension, like, “Lady, what’s your secret mission with all this stress?” I swear sometimes being a massage therapist is low-key detective work. Just kidding... kinda.

> Although, now that I think about it, could you imagine if massaging was like a crime scene clean-up? Oh, quick, gotta erase every hint of tension in 30 minutes, GO GO GO. I'd lose my mind! 🤯

So, yeah, back to the movie. Was super close to just downloading it ages ago since everyone's been yapping about how cool the plot twist was. Had to finally watch the movie and decide for myself if I’m Team Cleaner instead of just pretending to know what’s up at social gatherings. Gotta keep up, you know!

But honestly, kinda weird how some scenes made me wanna go clean my apartment. Like, inspire me to clean, and I'm a therapist, not a maid, come on! 😂 Is it just me? Does everyone else feel that? Maybe I've just tapped into a whole weird vibe where tension in movies equals motivation to sweep under the couch?

for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {} // what's this about? Idk, blame it on movie-induced brain fog.

But hey, now I’ve got this image of Jackson showing up during one of my sessions with all his cleaning gear and I can’t get it outta my head! Anyway, guess it’s time for me to tackle my own little chaos and maybe snack on something while I process this wild night. Catch you later! 🍿
